        "Cloud computing already embodies the concept of providing IT assets as utilities. Firstly, it is important to understand what we intend by the term market which makes cloud computing different from market-oriented cloud computing.\n",
        "The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines a market as a “place where a trade is conducted”. More precisely, market refers to a meeting or a gathering together of people for the purchase and sale of goods. A broader characterization defines the term market as the action of buying and selling, a commercial transaction, a purchase, or a bargain. Therefore, essentially the word market is the act of trading mostly performed in an environment—either physical or virtual that is specifically dedicated to such activity.\n",
        "What differentiates market-oriented cloud computing (MOCC) from cloud computing is the presence of a virtual market place where IT services are traded and brokered dynamically. This is something that still has to be achieved and that will significantly evolve the way cloud computing services are eventually delivered to the consumer. More precisely, what is missing is the availability of a market where desired services are published and then automatically bid on by matching the requirements of customers and providers.\n",
        "We can clearly characterize the relationship between cloud computing and MOCC as follows:\n",
        "“Market Oriented Computing has the same characteristics as Cloud Computing; therefore it is a dynamically provisioned unified computing resource allowing you to manage software and data storage as on aggregate capacity resulting in “real-time” infrastructure across public and private infrastructures. Market Oriented Cloud Computing goes one step further by allowing spread into multiple public and hybrid environments dynamically composed by trading service.”\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The realization of this vision is technically possible today but is not probable, given the lack of standards and overall immaturity of the market. Nonetheless, it is expected that in the near future, with the introduction of standards, concerns about security and trust will begin to disappear and enterprises will feel more comfortable leveraging a market-oriented model for integrating IT infrastructure and services from the cloud. Moreover, the presence of a demand-based marketplace represents an opportunity for enterprises to shape their infrastructure for dynamically reacting to workload spikes and for cutting maintenance costs. It also allows the possibility to temporarily lease some in-house capacity during low usage periods, thus giving a better return on investment. These developments will lead to the complete realization of market-oriented cloud computing.\n",

        "A reference model for MOCC\n",
        "Market-oriented cloud computing originated from the coordination of several components: service consumers, service providers, and other entities that make trading between these two groups possible. Market orientation not only influences the organization on the global scale of the cloud computing market. It also shapes the internal architecture of cloud computing providers that need to support a more flexible allocation of their resources, which is driven by additional parameters such as those defining the quality of service.\n",
        "\n",
        "A global view of market-oriented cloud computing\n",
        "A reference scenario that realizes MOCC at a global scale is given in Figure 5.1. It provides guidance on how MOCC can be implemented in practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Several components and entities contribute to the definition of a global market-oriented architecture. The fundamental component is the virtual marketplace—represented by the Cloud Exchange (CEx)—which acts as a market maker, bringing service producers and consumers together. The principal players in the virtual marketplace are the cloud coordinators and the cloud brokers. The cloud coordinators represent the cloud vendors and publish the services that vendors offer. The cloud brokers operate on behalf of the consumers and identify the subset of services that match customers’ requirements in terms of service profiles and quality of service. Brokers perform the same function as they would in the real world: They mediate between coordinators and consumers by acquiring services from the first and subleasing them to the latter. Brokers can accept requests from many users.\n",
        "\n",
        " At the same time, users can leverage different brokers. A similar relationship can be considered between coordinators and cloud computing services vendors. Coordinators take responsibility for publishing and advertising services on behalf of vendors and can gain benefits from reselling services to brokers. Every single participant has its own utility function that they all want to optimize rewards. Negotiations and trades are carried out in a secure and dependable environment and are mostly driven by SLAs, which each party has to fulfill. There might be different models for negotiation among entities, even though the auction model seems to be the more appropriate in the current scenario. The same consideration can be made for the pricing models: Prices can be fixed, but it is expected that they will most likely change according to market conditions.\n",
